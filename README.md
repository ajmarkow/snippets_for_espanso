## About <a name = "about"></a>

I love the snippet program Espanso.  It's an awesome piece of Free Open Source Software.  But I became frustrated with typos when I went to add snippets to the config file, which is .yml format.  I wrote these methods to simplify adding snippets and avoid those all too common syntax errors.
